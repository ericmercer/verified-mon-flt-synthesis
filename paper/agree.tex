This section formalizes AGREE's assume-guarantee reasoning by defining the set of verification conditions that AGREE must check.
The verification conditions succinctly summarize what in means when AGREE proves that a system implementation satisfies it specification.
These conditions are useful in understanding how the semantics in synthesis differ from those in the assume-guarantee reasoning in \secref{sec:semantics}.

This section then introduces the AGREE contract specification language through the cyber-hardened system of \figref{fig:hardened}.
It details the specification of that top-level system interface.
It then discusses the specifications for the filter and the monitor.
These two specifications are those that are synthesized to equivalent CakeML by SPLAT.
