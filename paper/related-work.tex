Assume-guarantee reasoning for compositional verification in reactive systems is well-studied \cite{10.1007/978-3-642-28891-3_13, composition1, 10.1145/2658982.2527272, 10.1007/978-3-319-17524-9_7}. Automated proofs of realizability for assume-guarantee reasoning are useful for engineers implementing components in the system \cite{10.1007/978-3-319-17524-9_13, 10.1007/978-3-319-29613-5_7}. Algorithms for actual component synthesis for Lustre models using k-induction or IC3/PDR provide an automated path from the assume-guarantee reasoning to an actual satisfying node implementation \cite{katis2017synthesis, 10.1007/978-3-319-89963-3_10}. These synthesis algorithms generate code in the Lustre modeling language but do not provide a path to a low-level implementation that could be fielded.
