In this section, we apply the BriefCASE tool to the development of a UAV surveillance system.  The system includes  UAV receives commands from a ground station to conduct
surveillance along a geographical feature such as a river. The on-board mission computer then generates a flight plan consisting ofa series of waypoints that the UAV must traverse to complete it smission. The UAV is also given a set of keep-in and keep-out zones that may constrain its flight path.
