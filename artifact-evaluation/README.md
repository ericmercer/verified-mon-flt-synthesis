The artifact to be evaluated is the SPLAT synthesis engine for the synthesis of high-assurance components from AGREE specifications. The AGREE verification engine is also included here as it is part of the example presented in the paper. 

SPLAT is actually part of a suite of tools from the DARPA CASE program. Only SPLAT is evaluated here.

All the BriefCASE tools are open source. See the [Formal Methods Workbench](https://github.com/loonwerks/formal-methods-workbench) for a complete description of what is in BriefCASE. SPLAT is available separately as a stand alone tool [here](https://github.com/loonwerks/splat). The submitted artifact for evaluation here is a version of splat bundled in BriefCASE and integrated in the OSATE.

All these tools are downloaded by the `fmide.sh` script (see INSTALL.md) and are publicly hosted on Github.

The versions of the tools used in this paper have been snapshot and archived for independent review:

The release includes a full binary version of OSATE2 with the BriefCASE tool set already installed. If using that version for evaluation, then skip to the tool usage examples in INSTALL.md.
